**(under construction)**

Welcome to the website related to the paper "_Mitigating Adversarial Gray-box Attacks against Phishing Detectors_", accepted to IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing (2022).

Here, you can download the _LNU-Phish_ **dataset**, the **source-code** for our custom-built _feature extractor_ (to obtain the feature representation of each sample in LNU-Phish), as well as for our implementation of the _Protective Operation Chains_ (POC) algorithm. 

If you use any of such resources, we kindly ask you to cite our paper (a preprint is [here](TBD)) with the following BibTeX entry:
